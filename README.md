This was a group project for the course: Management Tools for Business Data Analyst, held by professor Simone Di Leo, at the University of Rome "La Sapienza". This repositary contains the codes of all the analyses that were conducted, specifically designed to run in the RStudio programming environment.

The datasets used in this analysis have been derived from data provided by the Italian Ministry of Justice, with some obtained more directly and others processed through more complex methodologies. All links to both our datasets and the original data sources are documented in our report.

This research examines the effectiveness of alternative measures to detention, such as house arrest, probation, and community service, in reducing prison overcrowding in Italy and improving prison management. It also analyses regional performance, considering factors like overcrowding levels, impacts on critical events, foreign detainee incidence and the effectiveness of these policies. 
Advanced statistical tools, including ARIMA and Clustering Analysis, are applied to classify regions and predict future trends.
